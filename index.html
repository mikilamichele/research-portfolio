            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Emerging adulthood, defined as ages 18 to 29, is crucial for identity development. This research examines how geopolitical, ethnic, and moral identities shape political attitudes and behaviors in emerging adults in the United States. Understanding these interrelationships helps in addressing societal outcomes in a multicultural world.

            <h3>Theoretical Framework</h3>
        <p>Geopolitical identities encompass civic, national, and global identities. Ethnic identity involves belonging to an ethnic group, while moral identity reflects the importance of being a moral person. This framework explores how these identities interact to influence political attitudes.
